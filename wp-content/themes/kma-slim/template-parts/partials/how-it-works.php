            <p>Oil Fouling affects the inside of the coils, just like oil fouls a spark plug in an automobile
                engine.PowerBoost AC technology displaces the “oil fouling” and replaces it with a single molecular
                layer that bonds to the metal surfaces of the coil system. The technology will not allow the oil to
                re-attach thus increasing overall Performance for the life of the system. PowerBoost AC is a liquid
                added to the refrigerant of an existing air conditioner that results not only in immediate increased
                cooling efficiency and reduction of utility costs, in addition significant long term savings occur due
                to reduced costs of equipment replacement and repair.</p>
