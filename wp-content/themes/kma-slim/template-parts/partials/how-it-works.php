            <p>Something called “oil fouling” causes your AC to work harder than it was originally designed. Lubricating
                oil is part of what runs through your AC, but when oil film and deposits cling to the inside of your
                copper tubing, you lose performance. PowerBoost AC is scientifically engineered to displace oil fouling
                and prevent lubricating oil from ever reattaching to the metal surfaces again. And you can be confident,
                knowing that the PowerBoost AC approach to removing oil fouling has been verified as effective by the AC
                industry’s leading engineering organization. </p>
